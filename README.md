# Message Disappearing App
This simple application is built using Tkinter, a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python. The app allows users to type messages, and after a certain period of inactivity, the messages automatically disappear. Below are some key features and notes about the application:

## Features:
1. **Auto-Disappearing Messages:** Messages entered into the text area will automatically disappear after a 4-second pause in typing.

Initial Placeholder Text: The text area is initialized with the message "Start Typing" in gray. This text disappears as soon as the user starts typing.

Responsive Width: The width of the text area dynamically adjusts based on the window size, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Enter Key Handling: Pressing the "Enter" key inserts a newline character ("\n") into the text area.

Usage:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python your_script.py
Dependencies:
Tkinter: This application relies on the Tkinter library, which is included with most Python installations.
Notes:
The app uses event handling to trigger actions such as updating text width, handling typing and not typing events, and managing focus in and out events.

The disappearance of messages is triggered by a 4-second timeout of inactivity.

Feel free to customize the application as needed for your specific use case or requirements.
